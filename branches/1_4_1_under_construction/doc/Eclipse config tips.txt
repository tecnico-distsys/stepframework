Eclipse configuration tips

*** How to optimize Eclipse configuration for STEP Framework projects ***


-- General settings --

1 - Start Eclipse

2 - Go to "Window", "Preferences" and go to "filter text" box


3 - Type "ant"

Select "Editor", "Problems", check "Ignore all buildfile problems"


4 - Type "spell"

Select "Spelling", uncheck "Enable spell checking"


5 - Type "import"

Select "Java, Editor, Folding", uncheck "Imports"


6 - Type "log"

Select "LogWatcher", check "Restore previously open watcher on restart"


7 - optional - To disable incremental compilation - a.k.a. annoying distraction while thinking about code - go to "Window", "Preferences", "Workbench" and uncheck "Perform build automatically on resource modification".

To disable internal java builder altogether right-click on open project node, select "Properties" and then "Builders". Uncheck Java builder (i.e. turn it off) for that project.



-- Project settings --


1 - Go to "Project", "Properties"

2 - Select "Java Build Path"

3 - Select "Source"

Add all source folders.


4 - Select "Libraries"

Add JRE (jdk1.5)

Add Library, JUnit, JUnit 4

Add Library, User Library, jwsdp-essd-2009

Add JARs (all jars included in project lib)

Add Class Folders (all view/build/classes, ws/build/classes, ws-client/build/classes - these folders only exist after first build)


-- Tips --

Use Ant in command line. Eclipse stays more stable because compiling memory leaks don't accumulate over time.

Also, you can change into the desired directory and build only the component you're working on.

Typical example:

cd project
ant build
(wait 10 minutes)

cd project
cd subproject
ant build
(wait 2 minutes)
