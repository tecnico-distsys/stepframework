  abstract = {Organizations expect Web Services to make their information systems
	more agile so they can better adapt to changes in business requirements.
	Hence, this technology's design principles focus on interoperability
	and flexibility to give developers the ability to customize, reuse
	and enhance functionalities as well as non-functionalities such as
	security, transactions and reliable messaging.
	
	In particular, an effective Web Services customization must give application
	developers simple and expressive ways to program the changes they
	need without losing any capabilities available in the platform.
	
	We propose customization with Web Services Extensions and present
	the concept, its core mechanisms and its implementation on the STEP
	Framework, an open-source multi-layer Java enterprise application
	framework.},
